	/**
	 * All of the code for your admin-facing JavaScript source
	 * should reside in this file.
	 *
	 * Note: It has been assumed you will write jQuery code here, so the
	 * $ function reference has been prepared for use within the scope of
	 * this function.
	 *
	 * This enables you to define handlers, for when the DOM is ready:
	 *
	 * $(function() {
	 *
	 * });
	 *
	 * When the window is loaded:
	 *
	 * $( window ).load(function() {
	 *
	 * });
	 *
	 * ...and/or other possibilities.
	 *
	 * Ideally, it is not a good idea to attach more than a single DOM-ready or
	 * window-load handler for any particular page. Although JavaScript browser
	 * engines are considered single-threaded, these handlers do not execute
	 * at the same time; they all run one after another. Therefore, it is best
	 * to concatenate all of your JavaScript into one single file and let gulp,
	 * webpack or a similar task runner package them up for you.
